# IoT-Course-M2M-assignment
My final team assignment for my Internet of Things course from my December 2021 - January 2022 inter-semester at the Autonomous University of Baja California: a small Mosquitto-based M2M network. This assignment was developed by a 2-person team composed of myself and my classmate [LesliePVidal](https://github.com/LesliePVidal).
