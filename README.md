# IoT-Course-M2M-assignment
My final assignment for my Internet of Things course from my 2021-2022 winter inter-semester at the Autonomous University of Baja California (December 2021 - January 2022): a small Mosquitto-based M2M network that consists of a laptop with a Python script, an Arduino Uno with an Ethernet Shield, a BeagleBone Black with a Python script, an ESP8266 (NodeMCU) and a mobile phone.
